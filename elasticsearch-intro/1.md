In this section, we will look how to ingest data into the cluster.

* Multiple ways to ingest data into elasticsearch.
* Client libraries in multiple languages.

We can also use plain old curl.

```
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9200/test/users/1?pretty -d '{
    "first_name": "Mukesh",
    "last_name": "Swami",
    "gender": "male",
    "level": "super awesome",
    "age": 25
}'
```{{execute}}

It should give you a successful response.

We can also send JSON from file. I have already put a `test-data.json` file. Inspect it.

```
cat test-data.json
```{{execute}}

Now, make a POST request using that data.
```
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9200/test/users/_bulk?pretty --data-binary "@test-data.json"
```{{execute}}
